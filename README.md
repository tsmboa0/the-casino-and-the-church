# 🎰✝️ The Casino and The Church  

*A 2D pixel-style web game exploring the paradox of crypto and Web3.*

## 📖 Backstory  

Most believe crypto is one thing. They are wrong.  
It is two.  

On one side lies **The Casino** — flashing lights, spinning wheels, memecoin madness. Fortunes made, fortunes lost. A place where hope is pumped like oxygen, where laughter echoes alongside the sound of collapsing dreams. It is exhilarating, unpredictable, intoxicating.  

On the other side stands **The Church** — a hall of sermons, prophecy, and belief. Here, old texts are rewritten as whitepapers. Here, the faithful argue over visions of tomorrow, promising freedom and salvation through code. It is solemn, righteous, inspiring.  

But here is the truth:  
The Casino funds the Church.  
The Church built the Casino.  
Neither can live without the other.  

You are a wanderer between these realms.  
In the Casino, your **LUCK** will rise and fall as you play.  
In the Church, your **FAITH** will grow through writing, quests, and prophecy.  

But beware—if you spend too long in one realm, the other will fade.  
Too much gambling, and your faith begins to crumble.  
Too much preaching, and your luck runs dry.  

Balance is survival.  
LUCK fuels FAITH.  
FAITH shapes LUCK.  
Together, they decide your fate.  

Welcome to **The Casino and The Church**.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview  

The game is divided into two realms:  

### 🎰 The Casino Realm  
- **Slot Machines** – Spin for points/coins.  
- **Memecoin Simulator** – Experience the highs and lows of trading.  
- **LUCK Progress Bar** – Increases when you win, decreases when you lose.  

### ✝️ The Church Realm  
- **Write Sermons** – Choose from crypto topics and create sermons to raise **FAITH**.  
- **Prophecy Quests** – Complete tasks that strengthen your **FAITH** bar.  
- **Coin Costs** – Every church activity consumes coins earned in the Casino.  

### ⚖️ Balance System  
- Spending too much time in one realm decreases the other’s progress bar.  
- **LUCK** and **FAITH** are interdependent:  
  - High FAITH increases your odds at the Casino.  
  - High LUCK provides more resources to fuel FAITH.
