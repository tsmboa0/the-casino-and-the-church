  const storyText = `ðŸŒŒ The Casino and The Church ðŸŒŒ : A Tale of Crypto in Two Realms

Most believe crypto is one thing. They are wrong.
It is two.

On one side lies The Casino â€” flashing lights, spinning wheels, memecoin madness. Fortunes made, fortunes lost. A place where hope is pumped like oxygen, where laughter echoes alongside the sound of collapsing dreams. It is exhilarating, unpredictable, intoxicating.

On the other side stands The Church â€” a hall of sermons, prophecy, and belief. Here, old texts are rewritten as whitepapers. Here, the faithful argue over visions of tomorrow, promising freedom and salvation through code. It is solemn, righteous, inspiring.

But here is the truth:
The Casino funds the Church.
The Church built the Casino.
Neither can live without the other.

You are a wanderer between these realms.
In the Casino, your LUCK will rise and fall as you play.
In the Church, your FAITH will grow through writing, quests, and prophecy.

But bewareâ€”if you spend too long in one realm, the other will fade.
Too much gambling, and your faith begins to crumble.
Too much preaching, and your luck runs dry.

Balance is survival.
LUCK fuels FAITH.
FAITH shapes LUCK.
Together, they decide your fate.

So choose wisely, traveler.
Will you gamble with the Gambler?
Or pray with the Priest?
Perhaps both â€”because only those who master both sides of the coin can truly understand the world of crypto.

Your Mission is to achieve balance between the two realms. You will earn multipliers for achieving balance.
For example, you can earn a multiplier of 2x on the total $CNC tokens you've spent in the Casino and the Church.

Welcome to The Casino and The Church.

Enjoy the spectacles while you pray for the miracles.
